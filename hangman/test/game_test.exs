  ### pro implementation testing
  # 1. more tests -> more certainty
  # 2. tests may help us to understand implementation
  # 3. tests may drive the implementation

  ### contra implementation testing
  # 1. relevant implementation is already covered by testing the api
  # 2. internals may change -> tests will fail
  # 3. additional effort (at first glance)
